 Steps:

 Dependencies: redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, axios

 1. import create store from redux
    import provider from react-redux

    const store = createStore(reducer);

2. wrap App in Provider store={store}


3. create reducers folder and set up basic reducer and state

    const initialState = {}

    const reducer = (state = intialState, action) => {
        switch(action.type) {
            default: 
            return state
        }
    }
    export default reducer;

    import this reducer in index.js in Reducer and export it 

    import it in index.js (main);

4. set up components folder, create component file.

    const Player = props => {

        return 
        (<div> 
        
        </div>
        )
    }
    export default Player;

5. Import it into App.js and display it. 

6. in component file:
    import {connect} from "react-redux"

    const mapStateToProps = state => {
        return{
            hero: state.hero,
            games: state.games,
            win: state.win,
             isFetching: state.isFetching,
             error: state.error,
        }
    }
    export default connect(mapStateToProps, {})(Player);

7. Create Actions folder (index.js and playerActions);

    import axios from "axios";

    export const FETCH_PLAYER_START = 'FETCH_PLAYER_START';
    export const FETCH_PLAYER_SUCCESS = 'FETCH_PLAYER_SUCCESS';
    export const FETCH_PLAYER_FAILURE = 'FETCH_PLAYER_FAILURE';

    - create getData from api function:

    export const getPlayer = () => dispatch => {
    dispatch({ type: FETCH_PLAYER_START});
    axios.get(`https://api.opendota.com/api/players/${account_id}/heroes`)
    .then(res => {
        dispatch({ type: FETCH_PLAYER_SUCCESS, payload: res.data.value })
    })
    .catch(err => {
        dispatch({ type: FETCH_PLAYER_FAILURE, payload: err.response})
    })
    };

8. Export these const in the index.js/Action file.

    export { FETCH_PLAYER_FAILURE, FETCH_PLAYER_START, FETCH_PLAYER_SUCCESS, getPlayer} from "./playerActions";

9. Set up switch cases in playerReducer and import actions;

    case FETCH_PLAYER_START:
        return{
            ...state,
            isFetching: true
        }
        case FETCH_PLAYER_SUCCESS:
        return{
            ...state,
            teams: action.payload,
            isFetching: false,
        }
        case FETCH_PLAYER_FAILURE:
            return {
                ...state,
                isFetching: false,
                error: action.payload
            }

10. index.js - import thunk from redux-thunk and logger from redux logger
             - import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';
        import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
        import logger from 'redux-logger';

        const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

        const store = createStore(
          reducer,
         composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk, logger))
        );

11. MAKE SURE YOU IMPORT THE GETPLAYER FUNCTION TO YOUR COMPONENT AND IN MAPSTATETOPROPS EQUATION
